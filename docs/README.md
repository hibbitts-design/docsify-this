## Quickly display a Markdown file as a standalone Web page🚀

This Web app, built using the magical documentation site generator [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org) and the [Docsify Open Publishing Starter Kit](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit), provides a quick way to display Markdown files as standalone Web pages without needing to setup your own Docsify site. All you need is a publicly available Markdown file and pass that URL to https://docsify-this.net. Try it out below!  

## URL Builder for Docsify-This

Markdown File URL (GitHub or raw source URL):</br>
<input class="myfield" type="URL" autofocus="autofocus" onfocus="this.select()" id="text" size="200px" value="https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit/blob/main/README.md" /></br>
<input class="button mybutton" style="border:none;" type="button" id="btn" value="Display as Standalone Page" onclick="openURLs(document.getElementById('text').value,false)"/> <input class="button mybutton" style="border:none;" type="button" id="btn" value="Display as Standalone Page with Table of Contents" onclick="openURLs(document.getElementById('text').value,true)"/></br>

_To manually get the raw source URL of a file stored on GitHub, tap the **Raw** button when [viewing a file](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/viewing-a-file)._

## Additional Examples

* [GitHub Training Manual Working Locally with Git file](https://github.com/githubtraining/training-manual/blob/main/docs/06_working_locally.md), displayed as a [Standalone Page with a Table of Contents](https://docsify-this.net?basePath=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/githubtraining/training-manual/main/docs&homepage=06_working_locally.md&toc=true#/)
* [Single Page Docsify Open Course Starter Kit](https://github.com/paulhibbitts/cpt-363-user-interface-design/blob/main/README.md), displayed as a [Standalone Page with a Table of Contents](https://docsify-this.net?basePath=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulhibbitts/cpt-363-user-interface-design/main&toc=true#/)

## Technical Details

Entering the URL of a Markdown file into the above URL Builder, that file will be displayed as a standalone Web page in a new Browser tab. This URL may then be copied and shared for others to view the same page. The URL Builder will also automatically transform a URL to a GitHub Markdown file into the needed raw source URL (i.e. raw.githubusercontent.com).  

For example, to render the Markdown file **[README.md](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-course-starter-kit/blob/main/README.md)** (the expected default name) as a standalone page the URL would be:  
https://docsify-this.net/?basePath=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-course-starter-kit/main

To render the Markdown file **[README.md](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-course-starter-kit/blob/main/README.md)** (the expected default name) as a standalone page with a table of contents the URL would be:  
https://docsify-this.net/?basePath=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-course-starter-kit/main&toc=true

To render the Markdown file **[introduction.md](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit/blob/main/docs/introduction.md)** as a standalone page, the URL would be:  
https://docsify-this.net/?basePath=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit/main/docs&homepage=introduction.md

To render the Markdown file **[introduction.md](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit/blob/main/docs/introduction.md)** as a standalone page with a table of contents, the URL would be:  
https://docsify-this.net/?basePath=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit/main/docs&homepage=introduction.md&toc=true

_TIP: If not a README.md file, the filename will also need to be passed using the **homepage** URL parameter._

## Looking for more Customization and Control?

Docsify-This is intended as a quick way to display a remotely located Markdown file. If you want to further customize and control the presentation of your Markdown content you can install your own [Docsify Open Publishing Starter Kit](https://github.com/hibbitts-design/docsify-open-publishing-starter-kit) (that this hosted Web app is based on) and either store Markdown files within that site or with additional configuration render files located remotely. You can learn more about the capabilities of Docsify itself at [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org).

## Troubleshooting

_Updated Markdown file not displayed in the Browser._  
Docsify is likely displaying the last cached version. To ensure the most recent version of a file is loaded, do a [hard refresh of your Browser cache](https://www.makeuseof.com/hard-refresh-browser/).

_Embedded image not displayed as expected._  
The most likely cause for embedded images not being displayed as expected is the use of HTML (i.e. `<img src="images/filename.jpg" alt="Alt Text">`). Use Markdown for embedded images if possible (i.e. `![Alt Text](images/filename.jpg)`) to better support remote rendering.

_Embedded iFrame not displayed as expected._   
Due to iframe cross-domain issues embedded content may not be able to be displayed. Use the included rich media embed service [embed.ly](https://embed.ly/) as a workaround.  

For example, the following iFrame HTML:  

```
<div class="video-container-16by9"><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRnnRFelgw1ksq_p8Eryg3dnyLCRRLPf5fBgdwdv9p-tCIwcxqWvzDGrGbjxGHL7HqEJVpmV26ntk3a/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000" frameborder="0" width=780" height="585" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div>
```

Would be changed to:  

```
<a class="embedly-card" data-card-controls="0" data-card-align="left" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BLaaOTsGxDmNcAhg6pdx3hl9IvI8NErg8Oe5ceh83fw/edit?usp=sharing">Grav and Docsify Slides Placeholder</a>
```
